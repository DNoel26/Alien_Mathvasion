This game can be played using the mouse left-click only or keyboard arrow keys and spacebar to move and fire your weapon. Your spaceship below generates a random number and one of the enemy ships has the correct solution. Hit the correct enemy ship to reset them all or fail and watch as a new number generates with enemy ships coming even closer. The objective of the game is to survive both round 1 (addition) for 90 seconds and round 2 (subtraction) for 60 seconds. Whether successful or not, a report is generated at the end! Good luck young prodigies!!!
